To execute these commands in Termux, follow these steps:

1. **Open Termux**: Start by launching the Termux application on your device.

2. **Update and Upgrade Packages**:
   ```bash
   pkg update -y
   pkg upgrade -y
   ```
   - `pkg update -y`: Updates the list of available packages and their versions.
   - `pkg upgrade -y`: Upgrades all the installed packages to their latest versions.

3. **Install Termux Repositories**:
   ```bash
   pkg install tur-repo -y
   ```
   - Installs additional Termux repositories.

4. **Install Necessary Packages**:
   ```bash
   pkg install git nano binutils build-essential python3.10 -y
   ```

   echo 'alias pip="python3.10 -m pip"' >> $PREFIX/etc/bash.bashrc
   source $PREFIX/etc/bash.bashrc
   ```
   - Creates an alias so that typing `python3` or `pip` uses Python 3.10.

   - `cd instahack`: Navigates into the cloned repository directory.

7. **Upgrade Pip and Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python3.10 -m pip install wheel
   python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - Upgrades `pip` to the latest version.
   - Installs the `wheel` package and all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

8. **Clean Up Markdown Files**:
   ```bash
   find data/ -name '*.md' -delete
   ```
   - Deletes all `.md` files within the `data/` directory.

Each command should be entered line by line in the Termux terminal. Ensure that you have a stable internet connection during this process, as it involves downloading packages and files from the internet.
